I was raised in the town of Monroe, Georgia and I went to Apalachee Highschool where I wrestled and played tennis. All throughout highschool it was always my dream to eventually go to the <b>University of Georgia</b>.</p>
<p>
Since I have been at the <b>University of Georgia</b>, I have been involved in extracurriculars as well. My GPA is not as good, but it is only lower by a few points at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.88</span>. My fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho, is the main thing I have spent time with outside of school since I have been made the transition into college. Many people think fraternities are just for partying, but a lot of my success is because I have a group of people that push me to be a better student and get involved around campus. Besides my fraternity, I have been involved in the Interfraternity Council, UGA Miracle, and intramural sports.</p>

<p>
In the future, I hope to get an internship and eventually get a job as a financial analyst after I graduate with <I>magna cum laude</I> honors. I am also considering a Master's of Accountancy to go along with my finance major. Besides that, I am not sure what my future holds.</p>
